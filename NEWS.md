## Version 2.1.0

#### New functionality
* The new function ``fossils.to.pyrate`` can be used to convert objects generated by this package into PyRate format.
* The new functions ``fossils.to.BEAST.constraints`` and ``fossils.to.BEAST.start.tree.Rd`` can be used to convert objects generated by this package into BEAST2 format.
* The new functions ``subsample.fossils.oldest``, ``subsample.fossils.oldest.and.youngest``, ``subsample.fossils.uniform`` and ``subsample.fossils.youngest`` can be used to subsample fossil occurrences.

#### Function changes
* The innovative rates model has been integrated into the independent model in the function ``sim.trait.values``. Parameters are unchanged.
* The asymmetric plot function has been renamed ``rangeplot.asymmetric`` and separated from the ``SAtree`` objects.

#### Bugfixes
* Fixed several bugs in ``rangeplot.asymmetric`` that could lead to crashes or plots with missing edges.
* Fixed a bug in ``SAtree.from.fossils`` where ``SAtree`` objects were not created properly when using an empty ``fossils`` object.
