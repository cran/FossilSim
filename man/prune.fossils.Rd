\title{Removes all intermediate fossils from a combined tree and labels the first and last fossils of each lineage.
Can be used with sampled or complete trees. If only one fossil is present for a particular species it is labelled as first.}
\usage{
prune.fossils(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Combined tree with fossils.}
}
\value{
Tree with pruned fossils.
}
\description{
Removes all intermediate fossils from a combined tree and labels the first and last fossils of each lineage.
Can be used with sampled or complete trees. If only one fossil is present for a particular species it is labelled as first.

\examples{
# simulate tree

# simulate fossils
f = sim.fossils.poisson(rate = 2, tree = t)

# transform format
t2 = SAtree.from.fossils(t,f)

# prune fossils
t4 = prune.fossils(t2)

# or transform to sampled tree first
